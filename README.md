# TokenBar

**A native macOS menu-bar monitor for AI coding-agent token usage and quotas — with Liquid Glass.**

TokenBar sits in your menu bar and shows how much you're spending across
Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Copilot CLI and more —
today's tokens, live tokens/min, or how much of your subscription quota is
left. Click it and a glass popover opens with stacked usage charts, an
interactive 3D contribution graph, OAuth quota cards with pace projections,
and per-agent breakdowns. Everything is read from your local session logs;
nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## Install (beta)

```sh
brew install nanako0129/tokenbar/tokenbar@beta
```

Installs **TokenBar Beta.app** alongside the stable
[Tauri TokenBar](https://github.com/Nanako0129/TokenBar) — both can run at
once. In-app updates arrive via Sparkle. The app is ad-hoc signed (not
notarized); the cask clears the quarantine attribute on install, the same
disclosed approach the stable cask uses.

Requires an Apple Silicon Mac on macOS 14+. Liquid Glass needs macOS 26;
earlier systems get a vibrancy fallback.

## Highlights

- **The menu bar is the dashboard.** Show today's tokens or cost, all-time
  totals, live tokens/min, or remaining subscription quota. Quota mode comes
  in three icon styles — signal bars with a waterline, a ring, or a popsicle
  that melts as your 5-hour window drains — with battery-style warning colors.
  Right-click the icon to pick which subscription it tracks.
- **A running cat.** The classic RunCat-style pet paces with your token
  velocity — idle stroll between prompts, full sprint mid-session. Cat or
  parrot, with dark- and light-menu-bar variants.
- **Liquid Glass dashboard.** On macOS 26 the popover renders as clear glass
  cards floating over your wallpaper — the Control Center look. Six lenses
  (Overview / Models / Daily / Hourly / Stats / Agents) plus per-agent tabs,
  with animated transitions and full keyboard control (⌘1–9 tabs, ⌘[ ⌘]
  cycle, ⌘G chart toggle, ⌘, settings).
- **3D contribution graph.** A SceneKit year-at-a-glance token heatmap you can
  orbit and zoom, alongside 30-day stacked bars by model or agent, in tokens
  or dollars.

- **Quota cards with pace.** Codex and Claude OAuth limit windows with
  remaining %, reset times, and a pace readout — whether you're ahead of or
  behind your window, and when you'd run dry at the current burn rate.
- **Live session trace.** Tokens/min per agent while you work, with a
  network-LED activity blinker in the popover header.
- **Stale-data discipline.** A failed refresh never blanks or zeroes a
  display — the last known reading stays up until a fresh one lands.
- **Local-first, no telemetry.** Usage history is parsed from your agents' own
  session logs on disk. Network calls are limited to vendor quota lookups
  (with your existing OAuth credentials), model-price refreshes, and Sparkle
  update checks.

## How it works

Rust owns the data (session parsing, aggregation, pricing, quota fetching) via
the vendored [tokscale-core](https://github.com/junhoyeo/tokscale), exposed to
Swift as a C-ABI staticlib (`crates/tb_core_ffi`). Swift owns everything else:
SwiftUI views, the `NSStatusItem` shell, Sparkle updates.

| Part | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Rust FFI | `crates/tb_core_ffi` | staticlib; JSON-returning C entry points over tokscale-core |
| C shim | `Sources/CTB` | header + modulemap so Swift can import the FFI |
| Core | `Sources/TokenBarCore` | decode JSON into Swift models; pace/stats logic |
| App | `Sources/TokenBar` | menu-bar app (SwiftUI, Liquid Glass / vibrancy fallback) |

## Build from source

Requires Swift 6 and a Rust toolchain. macOS 14+.

```bash
make        # cargo build --release, then swift build
make run    # build + run the smoke binary
```

> **Note:** run `swift build` from the repo root — the linker's `-L
> target/release` path in `Package.swift` is relative.

## Credits

TokenBar began as a fork of [tokcat](https://github.com/handlecusion/tokcat)
by handlecusion, and the spinning-cat idea is theirs — tracing back to the
original [RunCat](https://kyome.io/runcat/) by Takuto Nakamura. Parsing and
pricing come from [tokscale](https://github.com/junhoyeo/tokscale) by Junho
Yeo (MIT). The native menu-bar shell patterns reference
[CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) by Peter Steinberger (MIT).
